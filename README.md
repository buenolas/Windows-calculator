#Windows calculator#

This is a project from an JavaScript on going course, the HTML I used from "Hcode treinamentos" as an example, and made all the JS code myself.
It's a project from section 2 of the course, and my first one using JavaScript, also as HTML,
so it might have some bugs that probably I will never notice but if I do, it will be fixed.
Feel free to give suggestions, complainings, congrats, help with bugs or whatever you like.
Thank you!

Specs:

-11 digits capacity.

-3 decimal places precision (if the number was supposed to be 0,0001 for example, it will be shown as 0).
